  <p> During the 2022-2023 School Year I taught attended my sophomore year at Piedmont High. In addition to school, I'm also a part of various extra curricular activities such as; Key Club, Investing Club, and the school badmnton team. I thoroughly enjoyed the year, and look foreward to my junior year.</p>
