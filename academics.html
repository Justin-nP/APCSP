	<p>I enjoyed all of the classes I took in my sophomore year. These classes included; Honors Chemestry, Honors Chinese, AP Computer Science Principles, English 3-4, Modern World History, Integrated Math 3, Orchestra, and Health Science. The class I had the most difficulty keeping up with was honors chemestry taught by John Savage. Although I struggled a lot during the first semester, I believe that I was able to keep up the second semester. Though the class was hard, I still enjoyed learning about all of the interesting concepts. The class that I liked the most was APCSP, as the workload was fairly light, but also was an interesting class.</p>
